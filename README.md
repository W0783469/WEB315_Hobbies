 Student name: Varinder Kaur student ID: 078346 Assignment - creating a new blazor app

Firstly, i created a new blazor app and created a new branch with name assignment 3 
Then, I deleted all the files from assignment 1 
Afterwards, update the content of the home page to display the values of those with name, theme name, and date and time. 
Update the incrementCount manthod in the counter razor component 
But, there are showing errors in code. i correct that now its good and counter is going from 0 to 15 and then come back to 0. 
Then, update the data and fetch.
 Moving to the next step, done and updated weatherForecastService.cs and NavMenu.razor.
  Now, new component updated. 
  Its working correctly.
